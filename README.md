# CCTweakedSnippets

This repository contains various CCTweaked snippets I have used in the ATM9 modpack. Below is a summary of the scripts currently available:

## Scripts

### Monitoring Refined Storage
Uses an RS Bridge to monitor items in Refined Storage.

### Monitoring Create Stress Levels
Utilizes a stressometer to monitor stress levels in Create setups.

### Monitoring TPS
Executes the `/tps` command (Forge) to monitor server ticks per second.

### Monitoring Induction Mekanism Energy Storage
Originally created by [obroadbent](https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerCraft/comments/1c9uv3u/induction_matrix_graphs_mekanism_computercraft/). Monitors energy storage levels in Mekanism's induction matrix.

### Central Monitoring with Rednet (Unfinished)
Contains an incomplete script for Rednet-based central monitoring. This was later replaced with setups using entangled blocks for greater flexibility.

## Notes on Usage

### Entangled Blocks
- I primarily use entangled blocks for these scripts due to their flexibility.
- If you want to run these scripts from a single central location, I highly recommend using entangled blocks.

## Folder Structure

### Monitor Folder
Contains unfinished and experimental scripts for Rednet-based central monitoring. These scripts are hardly started and were deprecated in favor of entangled block setups.

Feel free to explore and adapt these snippets to your own setups!
