CCTweaked Snippets I have used with ATM9. Currently has the below. 

Monitoring for Refined Storage using and rs bridge 

Monitoring for Create Stress levels using a stressometer

Monitoring for tps using forge /tps 

Monitoring for induction mekanism energy storage (made by obroadbent https://www.reddit.com/r/ComputerCraft/comments/1c9uv3u/induction_matrix_graphs_mekanism_computercraft/)

Monitor folder contains unfinished and hardly started rednet central monitoring. Changed this out to instead make use of entangled blocks instead
