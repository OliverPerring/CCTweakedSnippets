CCTweakedSnippets

This repository contains various CCTweaked snippets I have used in the ATM9 modpack. Below is a summary of the scripts currently available:

Scripts

1. Monitoring Refined Storage

Description: Uses an RS Bridge to monitor items in Refined Storage.

2. Monitoring Create Stress Levels

Description: Utilizes a stressometer to monitor stress levels in Create setups.

3. Monitoring TPS

Description: Executes the /tps command (Forge) to monitor server ticks per second.

4. Monitoring Induction Mekanism Energy Storage

Author: Originally created by obroadbent.

Description: Monitors energy storage levels in Mekanism's induction matrix.

5. Central Monitoring with Rednet (Unfinished)

Description: Contains an incomplete script for Rednet-based central monitoring. This was later replaced with setups using entangled blocks for greater flexibility.

Notes on Usage

Entangled Blocks:

I primarily use entangled blocks for these scripts due to their flexibility.

If you want to run these scripts from a single central location, I highly recommend using entangled blocks.

Folder Structure

Monitor Folder: Contains unfinished and experimental scripts for Rednet-based central monitoring. These scripts are hardly started and were deprecated in favor of entangled block setups.

Feel free to explore and adapt these snippets to your own setups!
